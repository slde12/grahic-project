Prooject Name: Search Algorithm Visualization

Name: Xuehui Chen

Algorithm: DFS, BFS, A*

Goal: To visualize the process of search algorithm step by step pair with the code excuting.
Minimal: to visualize a bfs search in a 2D plane with code hightlight during the search time.

Plan: 
1. Environment(processing)
	1.1 Basic element
	    1.1.0 Coordinate -- finished
                                Build a coordinate of the world space
	    1.1.1 World space(board)
	    	2D or 3D space -- 3D has been set up, goining to make a simple 2D plane version
	    	how to define the veiw space -- finished
	    	where should camera loot at? -- finished, just look at 0,0,0
	    	perspective camera or oth -- finished, not consider anymore
	    1.1.2 Balls(nodes)
	    	sphere geometry, phong material -- finished
		random generate node -- finished
		custom generate node -- finished
		mouse select -- in progress
	    1.1.3 Path(edge) --finished
	    	line geometry, line material
	    1.1.4 Lighting
	    	three spot lights

	1.2 Building environment
		1.2.1 Gui control
		1.2.2 Random generate(Auto)
		1.2.3 Custom generate

2. Algorithm(easy)
	chosen from CLRS book
    2.1 DFS (required)

    2.2 BFS (required)
    
    2.3 A* (TBD)

3. Animation(hard)
    3.1 Print log mark during the code Excuation
    3.2 Match the steps(printed logs) with the pusedo code
    3.3 Highlight node/path and code during the 


Deliverable
    a package including html, javascript
